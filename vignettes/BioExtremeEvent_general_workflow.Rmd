# About this tutorial

<br />

This tutorial describes the basic workflow showing how to characterized step by step
extrem event (Marine Heat Wave, water stress...)  using `BioExtremeEvent`
package. Other functions are available and their uses are illustrated in others
tutorials.

**DATA** The dataset used to illustrate this tutorial is a **METTRE ICI LE DATASET** based on
X sites (*i.e.* coordinates) and a (rasters of temperature) (*i.e.*  characterization of extrem event). 



<br />

The use of the `BioExtremeEvent` package is based on two datasets:

* a **data frame** of coordinates of sites call `sites_coordinates` in this tutorial

* a **stack raster** of temperature of mediterranean Sea call `sites_coordinates` 


<br />

This tutorial will guide you through the main framework, illustrated in the
flowchart below, step by step.
