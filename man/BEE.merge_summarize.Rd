\usage{
BEE.merge_summarize(
  data_metrics_point = NULL,
  data_metrics_morpho = NULL,
  data_escape = NULL,
  summarize_by,
  crs
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_metrics_point}{the output of the BEE.calc.metrics_point computed
using the argument group_by_event = FALSE.}

\item{data_metrics_morpho}{the output of the BEE.calc.metrics_morpho}

\item{data_escape}{the output of the BEE.calc.escape computed
using the argument group_by_event = FALSE.}

\item{summarize_by}{takes the followings options, into "" :
\itemize{
\item "extreme_event" for each metrics, a mean, median, variance, min and max will
be computed for each extrem event
\item "day" metrics are not summarized through time, the function keeps a daily
resolution and just merge the datasets.
\item "week" for each metrics, a mean, median, variance, min and max will
be computed weekly. Note that this imply to provide daily output
(BEE.calc.escape(only_days_EE = FALSE))
\item "two_weeks" for each metrics, a mean, median, variance, min and max will
be computed every two weeks. Note that this imply to provide daily output
(BEE.calc.escape(only_days_EE = FALSE))
\item "month" for each metrics, a mean, median, variance, min and max will
be computed monthly. Note that this imply to provide daily output
(BEE.calc.escape(only_days_EE = FALSE))
\item "year" for each metrics, a mean, median, variance, min and max will
be computed yearly. Note that this imply to provide daily output
(BEE.calc.escape(only_days_EE = FALSE))
